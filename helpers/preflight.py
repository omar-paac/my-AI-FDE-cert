"""What your network allows, established without hanging your notebook.

Tier 2 by convention. Standard library only — it has to run before anything is
installed, on a machine that may not be able to install anything.

Week 1 Session 1 writes this probe from scratch, and Week 9's challenge re-runs
it against the environment the app will actually deploy into. That second use is
why it lives here: TC9's ecosystem checklist is the same questions asked of a
different network, and nobody should rewrite the probe to ask them.

**The hard deadline is the feature.** A serial probe on a locked-down corporate
network — which is the case this exists for — can hang for minutes, because
`socket.gethostbyname` does not honour `socket.setdefaulttimeout` and a
blackholed DNS query blocks until the system resolver gives up. A diagnostic
tool that hangs on exactly the machines it was written to diagnose is worse than
no tool, because the student concludes their environment is broken in some new
way and stops. Every probe here runs in a worker with a wall-clock deadline and
reports `timeout` rather than blocking.

**Naming the interceptor is the point.** "TLS succeeded" is not the interesting
result on a managed laptop. *Who signed it* is. A corporate proxy re-signs every
certificate with an internal CA, which is why `pip` works in the terminal and
fails inside a container that does not trust that CA — a Week 1 mystery that
becomes a Week 9 conversation.
