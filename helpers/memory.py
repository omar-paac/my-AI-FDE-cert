"""Agent memory on SQLite, with the two things that break it in production.

Tier 2 by convention. Standard library only — `sqlite3` ships with Python, which
is most of why this is the right default.

Week 7 Session 1 builds this store from scratch and makes the argument for
stopping at SQLite rather than reaching for a vector database. This is that store
as an application would run it, with three differences that only show up once
something has been writing to it for a month.

**The FTS index does not watch its table.** `content='memories'` makes the FTS5
table external-content: it holds an index, not the text, and nothing keeps the
two in sync except triggers. With only an INSERT trigger — which is what most
examples on the internet show — editing a memory leaves it findable by text it no
longer contains and unfindable by the text it does. SQLite's own
`integrity-check` passes, because it validates the index against itself.

**Memory grows without limit.** An agent that remembers everything eventually
recalls nothing useful and costs a fortune doing it. `prune()` is not an
optimisation; it is the difference between a memory system and a leak.

**Recall goes into a prompt, and prompts have budgets.** `limit=5` bounds the
number of rows, not their size. Five long memories can be more text than the
question they were meant to inform, and the failure is a context-length error in
production rather than anything you saw in testing.
